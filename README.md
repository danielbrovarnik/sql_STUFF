# Tech Skills Salary Analysis in New York

## Introduction

This project analyzes tech skill demand and associated salaries in the New York job market. By examining data extracted from job postings, I aim to identify the most valuable and sought-after skills, gaining insights that will be valuable for my future career development and potentially for hiring strategies as I advance.

## Background

The tech industry is constantly evolving, and staying competitive requires a keen understanding of current trends and in-demand skills. This analysis focuses specifically on the New York tech scene, which is known for its diverse opportunities and high salaries. By understanding which skills are most valuable, I can make informed decisions about my career path and future learning goals.

## Tools I Used

* **Data Source:** Job postings data from [Luke Barrouse](https://www.lukebarousse.com/sql)
* **SQL:** For querying and analyzing the data using PostgreSQL.
* **VS Code:** As my code editor for writing and executing SQL queries.

## The Analysis

### Data Collection

Job postings were obtained from Luke Barrouse's dataset, which compiles tech job listings with structured details. The initial dataset included features such as job title, company, location, salary, and required skills.

### Data Cleaning and Preparation

* Removed duplicate job postings.
* Standardized skill names to ensure consistency.
* Filtered data to focus on New York-based job listings.
* Handled missing values by imputing or removing incomplete records.

### Analyzing the Data

* **Top Paying Jobs:** I first identified the highest-paying Data Analyst in NY jobs using the query in `1_top_paying_jobs.sql`.
``` sql
SELECT
    job_id,
    job_title,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date,
    name AS company_name
FROM
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id -- joins by company id to get name of company
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    job_location = 'New York' AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10
```

($140,000) and the lowest among them being a Business Data Analyst at Acadia Technologies, Inc. ($80,000), indicating a significant salary variation based on role specialization and employer.
* **Skills in Top Jobs:** Then, I analyzed the skills associated with those high-paying jobs using `2_top_paying_job_skills.sql`.
```sql
WITH top_paying_jobs_NY AS (
    SELECT
        job_id,
        job_title,
        salary_year_avg,

    LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
    WHERE
        job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
        job_location = 'New York' AND
        salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    ORDER BY
        salary_year_avg DESC
    LIMIT 10
)

SELECT

* **Overall Skill Demand:** To get a broader view, I determined the most in-demand skills across all job types in NY over 100k yearly salary using `3_top_demanded_skills.sql`.
``` sql 
SELECT 
    skills,
    count(skills_job_dim.job_id) skill_demand
from job_postings_fact
    INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
    INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE job_location = 'New York' and 
    salary_year_avg > 100000
GROUP BY skills
order by 
    skill_demand DESC
Limit 10
```

| Skill      | Demand |
|------------|--------|
| SQL        | 7      |
| Python     | 7      |
| Kafka      | 5      |
| Snowflake  | 5      |
| Scala      | 5      |
| Spark      | 5      |
| AWS        | 5      |
| Java       | 5      |
| Azure      | 3      |
| Redshift   | 3      |

SQL and Python are the most in-demand skills, followed by Kafka, Snowflake, Scala, Spark, AWS, and Java, while Azure and Redshift have relatively lower demand.
* **Top Paying Skills:** I then focused on identifying the skills that commanded the highest salaries with `4_top_paying_skills.sql`.
```sql
SELECT 
    skills,
    Round(avg(salary_year_avg), 0) as Avg_salary
from job_postings_fact
    INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
    INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE job_location = 'New York' 
and salary_year_avg is not null
GROUP BY skills
order by Avg_salary DESC
Limit 25
```
| Skill       | Average Salary ($) |
|-------------|--------------------|
| Jenkins     | 244,500            |
| Scala       | 201,334            |
| Spark       | 201,334            |
| Java        | 201,334            |
| Kafka       | 201,334            |
| Snowflake   | 201,334            |
| AWS         | 201,334            |
| DynamoDB    | 173,500            |
| Shell       | 172,557            |
| Azure       | 172,557            |

DevOps and Big Data skills are highly valued, with Jenkins, Scala, Spark, Java, Kafka, and Snowflake commanding the highest salaries, indicating strong demand in the New York tech market. Jenkins leads the pack at $244,500, followed by Scala, Spark, Java, Kafka, Snowflake, and AWS at $201,334. Cloud remains dominant, but niche skills pay wellâ€”specialized tools like DynamoDB ($173,500) and cloud-adjacent skills like Jenkins offer lucrative opportunities. While Python and SQL are foundational, specialization in high-demand areas can significantly boost earning potential.
* **Most Optimal Skills:** Finally, I combined insights from the previous queries to pinpoint the most optimal skills based on both demand and salary using `5_most_optimal_skills.sql` (broad, not location-based).
```sql
SELECT
    skills_dim.skills,
    round(avg(job_postings_fact.salary_year_avg),0) as Avg_salary,
    count(skills_dim.skills) as skill_demand_count
from job_postings_fact
    INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
    INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
where  
    job_postings_fact.salary_year_avg is not null
GROUP BY 
    skills_dim.skill_id, skills_dim.skills
having 
    count(skills_dim.skills) > 20
ORDER BY avg_salary DESC
```

| Skill            | Average Salary | Demand Count |
